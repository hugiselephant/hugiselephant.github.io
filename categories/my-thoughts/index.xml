It isn&amp;rsquo;t very hard to imagine something like AGI happening sooner than later&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That got me thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if AGI wants or needs to experience the world it needs a physical body. Otherwise nothing can be first hand experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a powerful intelligence designs and creates itself, Who made it? was it the humans? or is it spontaneous?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tangents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

Big or small changing the things that I can control like my environment, people around me, arranging objects and space that I spend most of my time, and people that I spend time the most to make my world more likely to create joy is as good of a goal as any other&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Rubber band of knowledge</title><link>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/rubber-band-of-knowledge/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/rubber-band-of-knowledge/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;How would you visualize all of the knowledge in the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sphere of knowledge that is growing very fast?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way I like to think about it is a rubber band that is being stretched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were to lay all of human knowledge in a line from easy to difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you could put people somewhere on that rubber band&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but because knowledge is growing so rapidly the rubber band would be stretching out really fast&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
