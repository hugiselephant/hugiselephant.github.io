We can experience a few months of &lt;del&gt;van&lt;/del&gt; truck life, but without burning gas, or worrying about finding a place to stay each night. I think with the right gear it can be a very simple yet comfortable trip. I have many places I would love to visit and experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
