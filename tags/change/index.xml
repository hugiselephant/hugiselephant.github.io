&lt;p&gt;Finally, after struggling year after year from seasonal allergies, my past self, one day in 2010 realized he needs to do something about it. He sent a message to me today in the future in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you never experience seasonal allergies, or any other allergies for that matter, it really sucks. Mine usually gets worse around spring and fall. My eyes and nose start feeling itchy, but I would usually miss the early signs. That is until one day it gets so bad that my eyes would constantly tear up, I can&amp;rsquo;t stop sneezing, my nose would be so runny and so sensitive that I can&amp;rsquo;t function for the whole day. That is when I would take allergy pills but it is too late. I am stuck in bed hoping for the symptoms to go away and it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to even open my eyes or breath through my nose.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
