So much is swirling around us so fast no human can possibly keep up. It will only get exponentially faster I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="welcome-to-the-singularity"&gt;Welcome to the singularity.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I see happening very soon, which is exciting to investors and businesses but scary and sad for workers is that everyone will start working on a last project that will train the AI to replace their own job. That story will sit pretty well with investors. Until of course even their jobs are taken. Soon enough all organizations will become Autonomous Organizations. It is just a matter of how soon. It is not as bad as you think.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
