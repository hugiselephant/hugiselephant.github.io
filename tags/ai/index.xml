&lt;p&gt;It is quite amazing what we know about our brains. It is even more amazing what we don&amp;rsquo;t know about it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that human brains do a lot is [[Pattern Recognition]] our brains are pretty good at it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What if I've never tasted wine?</title><link>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/what-if-ive-never-tasted-wine/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/what-if-ive-never-tasted-wine/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Thinking about the impressive capabilities of LLM these days, I thought of some other takes on the [[Turing test]], or the [[Chinese room]] idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if I&amp;rsquo;ve never tasted wine before but I can fake it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A blind person describing the color red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A con artist who pretends to love you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a car can drive as good as a human, then does it have awareness of the road like the human driver?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why do I need a thinking tool?</title><link>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/why-do-i-need-a-thinking-tool/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/why-do-i-need-a-thinking-tool/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;“A Bicycle for the mind”. That’s what Steve Jobs called the computer back in the 90’s, because it was a tool that made our limited human mind more efficient. Now imagine, driving past the old bicycle on a new “self-driving car for your mind”. I think it’s time we get a little upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s think about thinking, just bear with me for a minute&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have a lot of “knowledge work” to do these days. And most of that work is thinking, and then creating something from that thinking.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What if AI makes money</title><link>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/what-if-ai-makes-money/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/what-if-ai-makes-money/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;There has been no lack of AI anxiety going around. So let me just throw another idea out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if AI makes money?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course it will be programmed to make money on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course it is already better at a lot of things than most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course it will be better at doing everything even making money very soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AutoGPT already demonstrated that when given a goal an AI program can figure out how to achieve that goal.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>They say AI is going to take my job. Don't worry.</title><link>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/they-say-ai-is-going-to-take-my-job.-dont-worry./</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/they-say-ai-is-going-to-take-my-job.-dont-worry./</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Looking around at the the crazy pace of AI development right now, it is getting more and more impossible to focus on anything these days. So much is swirling around us so fast no human can possibly keep up. It will only get exponentially faster I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="welcome-to-the-singularity"&gt;Welcome to the singularity.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I see happening very soon, which is exciting to investors and businesses but scary and sad for workers is that everyone will start working on a last project that will train the AI to replace their own job. That story will sit pretty well with investors. Until of course even their jobs are taken. Soon enough all organizations will become Autonomous Organizations. It is just a matter of how soon. It is not as bad as you think.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>ChatGPT is getting crazy</title><link>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/chatgpt-is-getting-crazy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/chatgpt-is-getting-crazy/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Trying to learn what I can do with ChatGPT and found this. Seems like imagination is the only limiting factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I tried it too. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even have to do the first set up prompt. All I asked was one line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;generate code for a pong like game in javascript and HTML&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
