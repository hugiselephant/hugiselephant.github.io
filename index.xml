&lt;p&gt;What worked well?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for a while I was able to get into a bit of routine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What didn&amp;rsquo;t work so well?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not focussed enough to make something grow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;instead of forcing one way of doing things I am going to give some time to reset.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>DAO Pitch</title><link>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/dao-pitch/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/dao-pitch/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Many ideas are coming together.

&lt;p&gt;It used to be that if you remembered a lot of things you would be smart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You pass more tests, you go on quiz shows and people will come to you for knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology tends to level the playing field. Now that we have the interned in our pockets remembering things is no longer necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That got me thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if AGI wants or needs to experience the world it needs a physical body. Otherwise nothing can be first hand experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a powerful intelligence designs and creates itself, Who made it? was it the humans? or is it spontaneous?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sphere of knowledge that is growing very fast?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way I like to think about it is a rubber band that is being stretched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were to lay all of human knowledge in a line from easy to difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you could put people somewhere on that rubber band&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but because knowledge is growing so rapidly the rubber band would be stretching out really fast&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Small socks</title><link>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/small-socks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/small-socks/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I woke up with pain in my toes.

&lt;p&gt;There are things in life that you don&amp;rsquo;t notice at the time but after a long time you realize that it is causing pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminded me of the time I started wearing ear plugs at night because I realized I wasn&amp;rsquo;t getting enough sleep because of how sensitive I was to the sound in the morning.

&lt;p&gt;So why am I so excited about this release that I am writing about it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is because of one feature that I have been waiting for for so long&amp;hellip; Smart Merge.&lt;/p&gt;

So let me just throw another idea out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if AI makes money?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course it will be programmed to make money on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course it is already better at a lot of things than most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course it will be better at doing everything even making money very soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AutoGPT already demonstrated that when given a goal an AI program can figure out how to achieve that goal.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>They say AI is going to take my job. Don't worry.</title><link>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/they-say-ai-is-going-to-take-my-job.-dont-worry./</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/they-say-ai-is-going-to-take-my-job.-dont-worry./</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Looking around at the the crazy pace of AI development right now, it is getting more and more impossible to focus on anything these days. So much is swirling around us so fast no human can possibly keep up. It will only get exponentially faster I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="welcome-to-the-singularity"&gt;Welcome to the singularity.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I see happening very soon, which is exciting to investors and businesses but scary and sad for workers is that everyone will start working on a last project that will train the AI to replace their own job. That story will sit pretty well with investors. Until of course even their jobs are taken. Soon enough all organizations will become Autonomous Organizations. It is just a matter of how soon. It is not as bad as you think.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Creator collective</title><link>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/creator-collective/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/creator-collective/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We hear over and over that creativity is always one of the best skill to have for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forbes says &amp;ldquo;Creativity will be one of the most desirable skills in the future workplace&amp;rdquo;&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2022/08/22/the-top-10-most-in-demand-skills-for-the-next-10-years/?sh=4ddb06c117be"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WEF puts &amp;ldquo;Creativity, originality and initiative&amp;rdquo; among the top 10 skills of 2025.&lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/10/top-10-work-skills-of-tomorrow-how-long-it-takes-to-learn-them/"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I start with the Big Questions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What if creators were valued as much as business people?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>ChatGPT is getting crazy</title><link>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/chatgpt-is-getting-crazy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/chatgpt-is-getting-crazy/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Trying to learn what I can do with ChatGPT and found this.

We can experience a few months of &lt;del&gt;van&lt;/del&gt; truck life, but without burning gas, or worrying about finding a place to stay each night. I think with the right gear it can be a very simple yet comfortable trip.

&lt;p&gt;What good is a wallet with only one bill inside? You might ask&amp;hellip; Well, it was a magical wallet. I would be able to take the bill out and use it. Then magically another one appeared inside this magical wallet. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t that be nice? It is like the goose that lays unlimited golden eggs, or the fountain that never dries.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Sending a message to the future</title><link>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/sending-a-message-to-the-future/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/sending-a-message-to-the-future/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I just got a message from the past. &amp;ldquo;Allergy attack 2010&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s a message from my past self who is living in 2010 suffering painfully from a bad seasonal allergy attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, after struggling year after year from seasonal allergies, my past self, one day in 2010 realized he needs to do something about it. He sent a message to me today in the future in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you never experience seasonal allergies, or any other allergies for that matter, it really sucks. Mine usually gets worse around spring and fall. My eyes and nose start feeling itchy, but I would usually miss the early signs. That is until one day it gets so bad that my eyes would constantly tear up, I can&amp;rsquo;t stop sneezing, my nose would be so runny and so sensitive that I can&amp;rsquo;t function for the whole day. That is when I would take allergy pills but it is too late. I am stuck in bed hoping for the symptoms to go away and it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to even open my eyes or breath through my nose.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Santa Paradox</title><link>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/the-santa-paradox/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/the-santa-paradox/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about consciousness. Then I had a moment of profound realization. You know the moment you go from not knowing to knowing something. Our brain probably evolved to reward these moments since it feels so good when this happens. This must be the motivation for all the curious minds. Joy of learning I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly all the things other wise people said started to make sense like puzzle pieces falling into place. But then I had a thought. In this moment of profound realization I had no language to share this realization with anyone. Maybe I just need to realize more, or maybe the realization was still in my intuition/subconscious part of the brain. I need to work on this one a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What if you don't know what your goals and desires are?</title><link>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/what-if-you-dont-know-what-your-goals-and-desires-are/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/what-if-you-dont-know-what-your-goals-and-desires-are/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are constantly told that we should be true to ourselves and pursue our deepest desires, but what if you don’t know what your goals and desires are? What if you have no idea what your “life purpose” is or should be? Self-direction is impossible without self-knowledge. How can you know what you want if you don’t know who you are?
