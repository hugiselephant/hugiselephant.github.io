I saw an old couple getting out of the car. The old lady was having a hard time walking and was holding the man's elbow. There was something there, that must have reminded me of my wife holding my arm. I suddenly had tears in my eyes... I don't know why. Maybe I feel like I am seeing a glimpse of me and my wife in the future.
